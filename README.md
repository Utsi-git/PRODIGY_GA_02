Description:
This project demonstrates how to generate high-quality images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model. The code is optimized for running in a Google Colab environment, utilizing GPU acceleration for faster image generation. Users can customize various parameters such as image size, number of inference steps, and guidance scale to tailor the output to their needs.

Model Details
Model Name: Stable Diffusion

Model Overview:
Stable Diffusion is a state-of-the-art text-to-image model developed by Stability AI. It is designed to generate high-quality images from text prompts through a diffusion process. The model has been trained on large datasets and leverages advanced machine learning techniques to produce visually compelling results.

Key Components:

Diffusion Process: The model uses a diffusion process where an initial random noise is iteratively refined to match the text description. This process involves a series of denoising steps, which gradually transform the noise into a coherent image.

Text Encoder: A text encoder converts the input text prompt into a latent representation that guides the image generation process. This encoding helps the model understand and translate textual descriptions into visual content.

UNet Architecture: The core of the Stable Diffusion model is a U-Net architecture, which is used for the denoising process. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that facilitate the transformation of noisy images into clear outputs.

Latent Space: Instead of operating directly on high-resolution images, Stable Diffusion operates in a lower-dimensional latent space. This approach reduces computational complexity and allows for faster image generation.

Model ID: stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2


Features

Generate images from text using the Stable Diffusion model.
Optimized for GPU usage in Google Colab.
Configurable parameters for image quality and generation speed.
Prerequisites

Google Colab (recommended for GPU access)
Python 3.x
Hugging Face account (for model access)

Configuration

Configure the following parameters in the CFG class to customize the image generation:

device: Set to 'cuda' for GPU or 'cpu' for CPU.
seed: Seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility.
image_gen_steps: Number of inference steps for image generation (higher values yield better quality but take more time).
image_gen_model_id: Model identifier for Stable Diffusion (e.g., 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2').
image_gen_size: Dimensions of the generated image (e.g., (512, 512)).
image_gen_guidance_scale: Scale for guidance towards the prompt.
prompt: The text prompt to generate an image.
